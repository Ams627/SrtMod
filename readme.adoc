= SrtMod Subtitle Modifier

== Add or Subtract

Either the add or sub command is understood:

srtmod add 1000
srtmod sub 200

== Add or subtract a subset of the subtitles:

Add 200ms to subtitle serial numbers 14 to 23
----
sortmod add 14,23+200

----
srtmod q 83

----

== Check subtitles

Check the syntax of the file and report any errors.

----
srtmod check S02E01.srt
----

== Delete a range of subtitles

Delete a range of subtitles by serial number. Serial numbers are adjusted so that there are no gaps.

----
srtmod delete 201,305 S02E01.srt

== Sort subtitles

Subtitles should be sorted by time anyway, but occasionally you may find an out-of-order file. SrtMod can reorder them by time with the sort command.
It will renumber the serial numbers starting from 1.

----
srtmod sort show3.srt
